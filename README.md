OLD EDITS:

ABOUT ME:
{/_ <p className="">
I'm a self-made 25 year old freelance web designer and developer.
Growing up I'd spend most of my time surfing the web, learning and
researching something, or entertaining myself with video content and
browser games (rip Adobe Flash, what a good companion it was).
</p>
<p className="">
So I've always been familiar with websites, and for the past few
years, I've taken it up a notch turning myself into a front-end
engineer (check out my tech cloud!).
</p>
<p className="">
If you're interested in establishing your online presence or creating
a professional brand, whether you think you need something complex or
have a simple project in mind, feel free to get in touch and we can
have an honest conversation.
